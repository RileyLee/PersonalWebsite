                <p><blockquote>
                    I built a Halide-based cross-platform fast image proscessing solution to simplify hardware acceleration coding in
                    image processing. With out framework built on OpenGL Halide, GPU and CPU
                    image processing programs could be easily accelerated from scheduling. Meanwhile, Halide compiles them on all kind
                    of hardware platforms, iOS, Android, windows, webs apps and etc. During the project, I helped improve the Halide library with OpenGL.
                    In the meantime, I invented several new filters, such as graphic novel, pop-art and halftone.
                    Photoshop Express and Aviary have already been using our solution in their products.

                <h3>Multi-view Environmental Matting and Interpolation</h3>
                <blockquote><p class = "project" style = "text-align : justify;">
                    Matting and compositing a reflective/refractive object like a glass cup into a new environment and make it look
                    realistic from different perspectives is an interesting generalization of traditional greenscreen matting. Douglas
                    introduced the environment matting method to simulate reflection/refraction effect for single perspective. To solve
                    our multi-view environment matting problem, we implemented the traditional single-image environment method and
                    incorporated interpolation to generate environment matting for unseen perspectives. Experiments using DSLR images
                    and iPhone videos demonstrate promising results for both single-view environment matting and interpolation. We also
                    did experiments with Lytro-Illum camera and structure from motion to calibrate camera positions. They didn't turn
                    out to be successful but is a great lesson to learn.

                <h3>C++ based photon mapping engine for simulating fluorescent effects in vegetation canopies</h3>
                <blockquote><p class = "project" style = "text-align : justify;">
                    I built a ray-tracing (photon-mapping) physical engine to precisely simulate the generation and transmission of multi-spectral fluorescent effect
                    in dense vegetation canopies (Plant fluorescent effect has been proved very accurate in indicating plant health condition).
                    Compared to the traditional ray-tracing engines, this engine works with high precision and efficiency in the situation
                    where most of the spectrum energy is reflected by diffusion, also the sensors (airborne cameras) are limited by very tiny field of view angles.
                    In order to achieve this, I implemented GPU acceleration with openCL on CUDA architecture. The Monte Carlo chain is also
                    optimized by improved sampling techniques. This research leads to multiple
                    <a href="#Publication" >publications</a>, where we're still working on paper of simulating fluorescent effects.

                        In this project, I invented a fast mitosis detection pipeline applied to histopathological images.
                        The proposed method is similar to RCNN, where regional proposal is created by pixel-wise classification
                        using a random forest classifier. Image patches are then classified by multi-column convolutional
                        neural network. It was trained with different datasets, where pre-processing and data augmentation
                        were applied. The proposed method achieved an average 500 times speedup compared with the traditional
                        scanning window technique. In the meantime, we discovered new handcrafted image features which helps with mitosis detection.

                <blockquote><p class = "project" style = "text-align : justify;">
                    In this project, I worked on classifying grayscale images of plankton. They were created using scanners on sea-water
                    samples. Each slide contains thousands of targets of different species. The target size is generally 1 - 5mm. The
                    resulting plankton densities of different species are then used by scientists to analyze the fish production.
                    Specifically, I'm trying to develop a rotation invariant deep learning convolution neural network model, which
                    combines different handcrafted color and texture features to classify different species and their different phase.
                    I'm also going to explore an optimized pipeline to efficiently select and scan the region of interest.
