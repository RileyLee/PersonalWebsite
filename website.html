<p class = "subtitle"; style = "color : #424242"> Image Engineer / Computer Graphics / Image Recognition / PhD student at University of Washington </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p class = "summary">
    I'm a 2nd-year PhD student working on computer vision and computer graphics from University of Washington. My interests
    are mainly about image object detection, computer graphics, ray-tracing, high-performance image processing and artificial
    intelligence. I'm looking for a software engineer position preferably doing vision related projects.

<h2>Project</h2>
<h3>Cross-platform Halide-based Image Processing Pipeline</h3>
<p class = "project">
    I'm a 2nd-year PhD student working on computer vision and computer graphics from University of Washington. My interests
    I built a Halide-based cross-platform fast image processing solution to simplify hardware acceleration coding in image
    processing. Meanwhile I helped improve the Halide library with OpenGL. WithOpenGL Halide(C++), GPU and CPU image
    processing programs could be easily accelerated from scheduling. Meanwhile, Halide compiles them on all kind of
    hardware platforms, iOS, Android, windows,CPU PC, etc. Photoshop Express and Aviary have already been using our
    solution in their products.

<p class = "project">
    Matting and compositing a reflective/refractive object like a glass cup into a new environment and make it look
    realistic from different perspectives is an interesting generalization of traditional greenscreen matting. Douglas
    introduced the environment matting method to simulate reflection/refraction effect for single perspective. To solve
    our multi-view environment matting problem, we implemented the traditional single-image environment method and
    incorporated interpolation to generate environment matting for unseen perspectives. Experiments using DSLR images
    and iPhone videos demonstrate promising results for both single-view environment matting and interpolation. We also
    did experiments with Lytro-Illum camera and structure from motion to calibrate camera positions. They didn't turn
    out to be successful but is a great lesson to learn.

<h3>Mitosis recognition from histopathological images</h3>
<p class = "project">
    The count of mitosis existing in histopathological images is widely used in cancer diagnosis. So far, mitosis are
    mainly picked out visually by experienced technicians. The existing computer algorithm is mainly built on either
    deep leaning neural network or feature classifier with handcrafted feature selection and extraction method. In this
    project, I'm working on improving the state-of-art algorithm by merging these two mainstream methods above together.
    By using object segmentation, computer is able to find mitosis faster. In the meantime, handcrafted features
    contributes to a higher recognition accuracy.

<h3>CVPR 2016 face recognition challenge</h3>

    https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/8421#learn_the_details
</a>
<p class = "project">
    We built a face detector and classifier to recognize gender and facial expression in the contest datasets. The
    overall accuracy of predicting gender and facial expressions are 81% and 89%.
    Our team Let's face it (2 members, me and Deepali Aneja) ranks #5 of 77 teams with 84.7% overall accuracy on
    detecting facial expressions and gender detection. We'll make a web page for this very soon!! Click on this

<h3>Zooplankton recognition using deep learning neural network</h3>
<p class = "project">
    In this project, I'm planning to classify grayscale images of plankton. They were created using scanners on seawater
    samples. Each slide contains thousands of targets of different species. The target size is generally 1 - 5mm. The
    resulting plankton densities of different species are then used by scientists to analyze the fish production.
    Specifically, I'm trying to develop a rotation invariant deep learning convolution neural network model, which
    combines different handcrafted color and texture features to classify different species and their different phase.
    I'm also going to explore an optimized pipeline to efficiently select and scan the region of interest.
